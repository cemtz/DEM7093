## Course Description:
This course is designed to give graduate students interested in social science, population science and policy fields a hands-on introduction to the use of Geographic Information Systems.  The course will cover geographic data types, spatial data creation and management, exploratory spatial statistical analysis, and the basics of geospatial analysis.  At the close of the course, students will be able to use R and QGIS to create and modify geographic data, perform descriptive analysis of spatial data and integrate and map data from various sources into the GIS environment.  

### Computer skills:
We will be using R version (4.0.3) and Quantum GIS (QGIS) version 3.10 for this course.  QGIS is open source and free and can be downloaded for windows or mac (OSX > 10.13) from here:
https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html 

We will also be using R. R is the language in which most research statisticians work and current methodological developments are being made, it is also free and can be used on any operating system. 

Please update your R version (4.0.3) to the latest release and update all your packages.
We will use R through Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and we will use Rpubs for turning in all assignments.
### RTools
You should also install the version 4.0 install of Rtools if you are a windows user.
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
For those of you interested in R, I have published all of the examples from this class, and my other classes to my Rpubs site: http://rpubs.com/corey_sparks, so you can follow along with that stuff if you choose.

I will also post data and other resources to my Github repository https://github.com/coreysparks/DEM7093 

## R packages for the class
Copy and paste the following command in Rstudio to install the packages we will use in this class:

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreysparks/Rcode/master/install_first_7093.R")

In Rstudio. Please have these programs downloaded and installed prior to class.
